List of talks : 
1. **Anurag Sahay** : Roth's theorem is a special case of Szemeredi's theorem, which loosely states that every dense enough subset of the integers must have a non-trivial arithmetic progression of length 3. We will consider the historical background for this theorem and its many proofs, and discuss some proof ideas.
